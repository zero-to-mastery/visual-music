## What are ways of visualizing music? 

I'm going to take your original question title entirely at face value. First off, though, let’s remind ourselves what (were it not for the music industry) music is *really* about: [community](https://www.pinterest.fr/cantillate/diy-music-and-dance-images/).

Here an ad-hoc (certainly not exhaustive) list of 'ways of visualizing music':

* notations (semiotics - visualisations of pitch, tempo, rhythm, or -in the case of, say- dance, movement): [Music and Dance Notations (Semiotics)](https://www.pinterest.fr/cantillate/music-and-dance-notations-semiotics/)                 
* music instrument modelling (including actions such as fingering, chords and ornament): [STATIC World Music Instruments and Models](https://www.pinterest.fr/cantillate/static-world-music-instruments-and-models/)        
* music theory (tool) modelling: [STATIC Music Theory Visualization Examples](https://www.pinterest.fr/cantillate/static-music-theory-examples/)          
* simple categorisation (from the body of your question): tree structures representing such as genre, instrument families, theory and other hierarchies: [Music Classification Systems](https://www.pinterest.fr/cantillate/music-classification-systems/)               
* representation of the underlying physical and mathematical properties (a sort of ‘own bellybutton gazing’): [Music, Physics and Mathematics](https://www.pinterest.fr/cantillate/music-physics-and-mathematics/)             
* performance structure: [Music Performance Insights](https://www.pinterest.fr/cantillate/music-performance-insights/)       
* cultural (modal) framework:

[STATIC Rhythm Theory Examples](https://www.pinterest.fr/cantillate/static-rhythm-theory-examples/)                  
* hybrid visualisations (such as for example, in esoterics: coincidental mappings between, for example, the western 12-tone system and astrological signs): [STATIC Musical Esoterica Examples](https://www.pinterest.fr/cantillate/static-musical-esoterica-examples/)               
* use of colour: [Music and Color / Colour](https://www.pinterest.fr/cantillate/music-and-color-colour/)          
* purely cosmetic visualisations (the 'useless fractal visualizations' you mention above)                              
* games: [Music Theory Games](https://www.pinterest.fr/cantillate/music-theory-games/)               

Note the frequent use of the word ‘static’. “Useful” music visualisation is -in a dynamic sense- a more or less greenfield application area.

Given the vast range of temperaments, intonations, notes or tones per octave, tunings, sound channels (such as number of strings, rows or tubes) and timbres represented by world music instruments, however, dynamic music visualisation represents a HUGE field of study.

Nevertheless, you can see some videos and screenshots of a proof of concept for a world music aggregator platform linking musical notation with DYNAMIC theory tools and instrument models.

The aims are to:

* strengthen musical diversity by providing open-source tool support for person-to-person (now P2P) music learning, worldwide.     
* model any world music instrument -by family- directly in the browser, each derived from a generic base.    
* link world music instruments and associated theory tools across their entire configuration spectrum, allowing direct visual comparison of the impact of configuration changes.       
* ultimately, drive all visualisations directly from source, be that remote (P2P) musician, notation, audio recording, midi or whatever        
* the ability to incorporate/represent elements of individual style      

Providing music sources -especially music exchange formats such as MusicXML- can keep pace, such a system may have the potential to display multiple, dynamic, interactive, highly configurable and completely synchronised views in a groundbreaking collaborative, visual and immersive learning environment.

This system in particular is to be the subject of a crowdfunding campaign bearing the hashtag ‪#‎WorldMusicInstrumentsAndTheory‬. It will build on the open source (‘code-reuse-tolerant’) conventions widespread in the data visualisation sector.

Coming back to the body of your question, many of music’s deeper structures are represented by datasets and patterns, so are directly accessible to data visualization techniques.

It’s worth keeping in mind, though, that many seasoned traditional / folk virtuosos will have a repertoire of thousands of tunes and an intuitive familiarity with the underlying cultural / modal framework, all this gained *simply by doing*.

Music and dance have, indeed, held communities together over millennia. Perhaps artificial intelligence (automated learning) will ease or hasten the path to musical virtuosity, but in the meantime I feel it is essential -for our own wellbeing- to restore music’s original, inclusive and social context.

Moreover, as folk tune or melody history quickly reveals, 1:1 (face-to-face, ear or assimilation) learning is more or less a guarantee of musical diversity. Given community, music *lives*. In a digital age, we may just need to find new ways of tapping into this stream.

Above all, it is imperative we find a healthy, collaborative counterweight to the factory music monoculture and the catastrophic lifestyle excesses of it’s role models.

Diversity is all. First step? Visualisation.
